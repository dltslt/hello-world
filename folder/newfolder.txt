I needed to put a file in a folder, to create a folder!

So, then let's create some more commits!
To have more green dots on the dashbord ;)
YAY

Indeed, more green dots there :)
And I am writing this in VS Code with integrated github support, testing it's features.

How come, that onle the new file in the other new folder shows up as changes?
Ah... because I didn't save the other changes locally yet.
