the folder needs a file

and now it has one.

the idea is now, to upload this AND create a new branch
to achieve this, i need to 'stage' my changes first..
when i forget to hit the save button, the changes are of course not recognised.
doing this now, creates a new change => which i stage now

-----

alright, there are LOCAL and REMOTE repositories and/or branches...
i am currently working an a newly generated branch 'vscode-changes' which appears only locally - weird
lets see, whether i manage to upload this branch or not
=> or so i thought... there is an 8 sign key... which is THE SAME as origin/main branch
confusing
i commit these changes and now this key is different... so confusing
